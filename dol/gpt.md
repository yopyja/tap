|-------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Do Your Research                     | Before negotiating, research the average salary for the position in your industry and location. This will give you a benchmark to aim for.                  |
| 2     | Practice Negotiation Skills          | Practice your negotiation conversation with a friend or family member. This will help you to be more confident and articulate during the actual negotiation. |
| 3     | Be Prepared to Explain Your Worth    | Be ready to explain why you deserve the salary you are asking for. Highlight your skills, experience, and contributions.                                   |
| 4     | Don't Be the First to Give a Number  | Let the employer make the first offer. This can give you an advantage as you can then negotiate up from their initial offer.                               |
| 5     | Be Patient                           | Don‚Äôt feel pressured to accept the first offer. Take your time to think it over and, if necessary, make a counteroffer.                                     |
| 6     | Consider the Entire Package          | Salary is just one part of the compensation. Consider other benefits like health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off.                            |
| 7     | Use Positive Language                | Use positive and collaborative language. This shows that you are not only interested in your benefit but also in the success of the company.                |
| 8     | Be Ready to Walk Away                | Know your worth and be prepared to walk away if the offer does not meet your expectations. This can sometimes lead to a better offer.                        |
| 9     | Get the Offer in Writing             | Once you have negotiated your salary and benefits, ask for a written offer. This ensures that there are no misunderstandings later on.                       |
| 10    | Express Gratitude                    | Regardless of the outcome, thank the employer for the opportunity to discuss your compensation. This leaves a positive impression.                          |
